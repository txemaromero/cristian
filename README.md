Cristian's algorithm implementation in C

Cristian's algorithm is a method for clock synchronisation which can be used in many fields of distributive computer science but is primarily used in low-latency intranets.

An example is implemented in C language using Knoppix GNU/Linux as operating system (see image). It is based on TCP/IP. TCP/IP refers to two protocols that work together to deliver data: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).
